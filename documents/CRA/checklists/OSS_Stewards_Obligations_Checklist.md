This is a checklist of the requirements Open Source Stewards must fulfill to meet the requirements laid out in the CRA

An Open Source Steward is defined in [Article 3.14](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202402847#art_3) as:
> a legal person, other than a manufacturer, that has the purpose or objective of systematically providing support on a sustained basis for the development of specific products with digital elements, qualifying as free and open-source software and intended for commercial activities, and that ensures the viability of those products
