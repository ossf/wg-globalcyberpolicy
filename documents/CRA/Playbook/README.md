# LF CRA Playbook #

Congratulations!  You are one of the parties that controibute to "Products with Digital Elements" (PDE) as detailed in [Article 6](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202402847#art_6) that will be sold within the European Union.  You are an upstream open source devel;oper, get to be an open source Steward, or perhaps you are a Manufacturuer 
as outlined within the [EU’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202402847#art_3). You are vitally important in supporting upstream projects, developers, and maintainers as they go about the task of 
maintaining and creating innovative solutions that solve the world’s problems. 

Tnis document is intended to be a living playbook of terms, artifacts, entities, and expected processes you will see and hear about as part of the implementation of the CRA in September 2026 and December 2027.

## Open Source Developers ##
The CRA puts no legal obligations for the overwhleming majority of people that create and contribute upstream opne source software.  Just because you do not have legal obligations does not mean that your downstream consumers 
will not appraoch you to provide them infoation that THEY need to fulfill THEIR legal obligations.
[Recital 15](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202402847#rct_15) speaks to "intention of 'making a profit'" as one possible area that open soruce projects and developers need to understand where they 
*may* be considered to have more obligatipons under the law in line with Manufactureurs.  The OpenSSF and other upstream foundations are working with the European Commission (ec) to provide better definitiaon ad clarity around statemns like this to help guide upstream.

## Open Source Stewards ##
[Article 24](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202402847#art_24) describes the three obligations that OSS Stewards must fulfill.  
The Steward role was recognized early on by EU policymakers as distinct from the software creators and the commercial organizations that sell products using those technologies.

While open source software stewards are not subject to the full obligations imposed on manufacturers under this Regulation (and therefore may not affix the CE marking to supported digital products), they remain responsible for implementing a security strategy, reporting vulnerabilities, and cooperating with market surveillance authorities to ensure the cybersecurity and integrity of open source projects. 

## Manufacturer ##
[Article 13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202402847#art_13) lays down the obligations of Manufacturers under the CRA.
